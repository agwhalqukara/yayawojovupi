cases of a footballer being called up by his country but asked to play in a role that isn't the one undertaken on a weekly basis.</p><p>Given that not-insignificant piece of information, it still seems a little disrespectful that some Albiceleste fans are yet to truly take him to their hearts, suggesting he plays better for Barca than Argentina.</p><img alt="Pele has weighed in on the argument as to the way in which Messi plays for club v country." src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl

class=caption>Pele has weighed in on the argument as to the way in which Messi plays for club v country.</span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>FRANCK FIFE/Getty Images</span><p>Even <a href=#>Pele</a> weighed in on that particular argument last April, telling FIFA.com (h/t&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goal</a>):</p><p>When he's in Spain, with Barcelona, with a team he already knows and knows well, he's a player.&nbsp;</p><p>But Messi when he's with the Argentinian team is not the same thing.&nbsp;It's a different way of playing<span>—</span>the Argentinian team is not organised the same way.</p><p>The same thing happens with&nbsp;<a href=#>Neymar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Brazil</a>.</p><p>It's an interesting point because how many times have the Albiceleste coasted along on the coat tails of their best player and been inspired by the deeds of their captain?</p><p>At club level, Messi arguably has a better and more cohesive unit around him, which allows his wanderlust to flourish.</p><p>Ostensibly now an attacker who dominates the right-hand channel for Barca, it's no surprise when we see him popping up on the opposite flank or centrally.</p><p>Luis Enrique is getting the best out of his No. 10 precisely because he is giving him licence to roam within the framework of the team unit.</p><img alt="Having Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets behind him at club level allows Messi to operate much further forward than he does for Argentina." src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png

class=caption>Having Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets behind him at club level allows Messi to operate much further forward than he does for Argentina.</span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Vladimir Rys Photography/Getty Images</span><p>Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets, Neymar, <a href=#>Luis Suarez</a> and Co. are completely in tune with the same, and as such, they have made themselves into a more complementary support act for their main man.</p><p>In <a href=#>Sergio Aguero</a>, Angel Di Maria et al, Messi isn't let down in the quality department but arguably has to take on more responsibility in an attacking sense.</p><p>At Barca, as soon as Messi has possession he's on his bike without a second thought, knowing that if he doesn't have the beating of his marker from the off, that the trade-off is that wonderfully penetrative short, sharp passing game in and around the penalty area that he and Barca excel at.</p><img alt="Sergio Aguero is a fine striker for Messi to play off of." src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl

class=caption>Sergio Aguero is a fine striker for Messi to play off of.</span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>EITAN ABRAMOVICH/Getty Images</span><p>For Argentina, Messi is often as far back as the halfway line as a move begins to develop and will tend to be more direct in possession.</p><p>With Di Maria and Aguero's excellent movement a nightmare for defences, fanning out in front of Messi gives him the space and time required to be at his devastating best<span>—</span>something that's not always available to him at club level.</p><p>What's also worth pointing out is Messi's intelligence as a footballer; his ability to adapt to those around him and tailor his own role accordingly is peerless. &nbsp;</p><p>In so doing, his influence can be seen in both teams to varying degrees, and his vision and pinpoint delivery have taken over from his goalscoring feats on occasion.</p><p>He's still able to be a lethal hitman when required at club level and a creative genius internationally, even if we are beginning to see the green shoots of the latter for the Blaugrana.</p><p>It's hard to argue which is the better version of the player, but what's not difficult to accept is that both deserve the continued plaudits and adulation.</p><p>With at least another World Cup in him, it would be a just reward for Messi to lift the greatest prize that football has to offer.</p><p>Perhaps then he will be as revered by his own people as he is by the Catalans who chant his name with vigour at each home game.</p><p class=postsid
