I had the opportunity to spend some time chatting with Mark about his experiences in LA, his time in MN, and what he’s been up to since.</p><p>So where did that crazy nickname come from, anyway? Madsen says the tagline came long before his basketball career. In fifth grade, Madsen’s P.E. teacher enjoyed handing out nicknames. When he dubbed one of his students “Mad Dog Madsen,” the name stuck.</p><p>Madsen played NCAA ball at Stanford University where his reputation for aggressive defensive play gained a foothold. When he graduated, the California native was ranked in the school’s top 10 in blocks and rebounds. In 2000, the Los Angeles Lakers drafted Madsen in the first round (29th pick overall).</p><p>Madsen held a spot in the Lakers&nbsp;lineup from 2000 to 2003, during which he contributed to back-to-back Lakers&nbsp;championships. When reflecting on his time on the west coast, the forward expressed a sort of gratitude on being able to play with both Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant, arguably two of the best athletes to ever compete in the NBA. In addition, Madsen played under the direction of Hall of Fame Coach Phil Jackson.</p><p>According to Madsen, Jackson had a significant impact on the way he viewed himself as both a player in the NBA and, more specifically, as a member of the championship-caliber Lakers. One instance in particular stands out:</p><p>“I was sitting in the locker room when Phil Jackson said something that stuck with me. ‘Every person in this room has unique gifts and talents that can help us win basketball games.’ That impacted me a lot,” said Madsen. “Playing with the Lakers, it’s easy to think that Kobe and Shaq carry the load [as the superstars]. But in reality, every person helped the group succeed as a whole.”</p><p>Along with Jackson, Madsen felt mentored by fellow Laker&nbsp;O’Neal. “[Shaq’s] kind of a rare person. Not only is he a great basketball player, but he’s a great guy. He loves to have fun, loves to help other people. Not only was he great himself, but he helped develop the younger players, including myself.” Madsen commented on O’Neal’s movement between teams during the last few years of his career. Although O’Neal has at times been criticized for moving to other ball clubs after creating a legacy in LA, his former teammate expressed only positive sentiments, saying he was happy for O’Neal and his ability to create wins wherever he goes.&nbsp; “When you look at it, almost every team he’s been on (with the exception of <a href=#>Phoenix</a>) has been a championship contender. That says something huge about him as a player.”</p><p>Although Madsen may have been a bench player in LA, he stole the spotlight at the 2001 and 2002 Lakers Championship when he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">danced</a> a quirky number to a rap performed by O’Neal. Jested in fun by fans and teammates alike, Madsen remains known for his infamous routine – or lack thereof. So many fans wonder: would Mad Dog compete on the popular reality show Dancing with the Stars? Madsen enjoyed the question, saying that he loved the show and would probably do it if he was asked and time allowed. “But,” he added, laughing, “I don’t think I’m a good enough dancer to do that.” So who is? Madsen said he would love to see a few NBA players on the show, including Sam Cassell, Latrell&nbsp;Sprewell, and even Kobe.</p><p>Following the 2002-2003 season, Madsen transitioned to Minnesota as a free agent. There, fans loved to watch the explosive defender come off the bench and add energy to the hardwood. During his first season with the Timberwolves, Madsen contributed to a playoff series victory over <a href=#>Sacramento</a>. Fans especially remember his aggressive fourth quarter in which he grabbed multiple offensive rebounds to keep play alive.</p><p>In Minnesota, Madsen again had the opportunity to play alongside a championship-caliber athlete in Kevin Garnett. Although Garnett may have earned more minutes, both he and the forward out of Stanford were crowd favorites. Madsen appreciated Garnett as a friend off the court as well. He recalls one instance in particular in which he was sidelined due to undergoing surgery for a minor injury. While he attended a physical therapy appointment, Garnett had a “get-well” package sent to Madsen’s home in Eden Prairie. “He’s a superstar, he’s won championships, but he was okay reaching out to the role players. He had a really great relationship with everyone on the team and cared about everyone.”</p><p>Madsen spent six seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves&nbsp;before being traded on July 20, 2009. The trade sent him to the <a href=#>LA Clippers</a> (along with Craig Smith and Sebastian Telfair) in exchange for Quentin Richardson. Unfortunately, the transaction wrapped up Madsen’s NBA career as he was waived by the Clippers in August.</p><p>However, the fan favorite remained proactive in the basketball world and continued to pursue his education. Madsen served as an assistant coach for the Utah Flash last season, a position he enjoyed. One might wonder how coaching compares to playing for a former NBA athlete.</p><p>“They’re both unique in a very different way. When you play, its all about getting yourself keyed up for the game. Sometimes you play great. You can’t miss – it’s like throwing a rock into the ocean. But other times the rim doesn’t seem any wider than a dime, and you can’t make a shot. As a player you have to figure that out. You’re always competing against someone else.”</p><p>Madsen elaborated, explaining that while playing is both mental and physical, coaching is 100 percent mental. Flash Head Coach Brad Jones compares coaching to being a psychologist, an analogy Madsen agrees with. “Players go through ups and downs,” he commented. “Players know how to play, but it’s nice when you have a coach that’s been there too.”</p><p>Being able to weigh in with some coaching experience under his belt, Madsen discussed both the current situation and the future of the Timberwolves franchise. He didn’t hesitate to focus on the importance of Kevin Love as a part of the equation. “Kevin Love brings a lot to the table. He’s a great competitor – who ever gets 30 rebounds in a game? Kevin has a huge heart, number one. When the ball comes off that backboard, he wants it. And he’s going to get it.”</p><p>Madsen compared Love to former NBA forward Dennis Rodman, an athlete who made a significant impact on the league and led his team to victories. In addition, he acknowledged the unique gift Love has for not only rebounding, but also being able to hit the three-point shot and create open space on the floor for his teammates.</p><p>With Michael Beasley being added to the lineup this season, Madsen feels it can only get better.&nbsp; “It’s a great combination. Beasley and Love compliment each other in a lot of ways. They can both shoot; they have great on-court chemistry […] and as the Wolves move toward being a playoff team, Love and Beasley will seem that much better because they have all that experience under their belt.”</p><p>Along with trying his hand at coaching, Madsen pursued further education by returning to Stanford where he is currently attending to complete his MBA. “Education is so important,” he stressed. “Look at Adonal&nbsp;Foyle. He was getting his Master’s at the same time that he was playing actively in the NBA! For me, I thought it would be great to get more education so that if there are things I might want to do later in life, the doors are more wide open.”</p><p>So what’s next for Mad Dog? He says we’ll just have to wait and see. While he is considering getting back into sports on the management side of things, his current focus is doing well in school and finishing strong. “Starting out as something like an assistant manager might be interesting.”</p><p>“Or,” he added, laughing, “I might decide to do something totally different.” Whatever he decides, one thing is for sure: MadDog will continue to find success and impact the lives of those around him for the better. On the court or off.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJobWlpZG5%2FbrnAq6JmpZGZsbCzjKaYnauVo3q1tMRmpJqmXZeyqbXNnWStoJViuaK3xKuqZpyRo7Cm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mark-the-bird-fidrych-54-dies-in-apparent-accident-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-ru.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mark The Bird Fidrych, 54, Dies in Apparent Accident | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Ru">&larr;
