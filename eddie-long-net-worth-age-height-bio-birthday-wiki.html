Long’s sermons, writings and teachings emphasize a “chain of command” between certain superiors and subordinates characterized by “respect, submission and obedience”. Long saw the first link in the chain as being a man choosing to be respectful, submissive and obedient to God. A woman chooses to be respectful, submissive and obedient to her father or husband. To live otherwise is to be outside of the divinely established order, and will result in the loss of spiritual and natural benefits. Long was considered a preacher of the prosperity gospel who taught that his followers would be blessed with material wealth.</p><h2>Eddie Long Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Eddie Long is one of the <strong>richest Religious Leader</strong> from United States.

Floyd M. Long, Jr. and Hattie Long. He attended North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina, where he received a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration in 1977. In 2008, Long donated $1 million to the university to establish a professorship in his name, saying “I am making (the donation) from my own personal income,” which comes from various real estate ventures and also as royalties from his books. Long then worked as a factory sales representative for the Ford Motor Corporation, but was fired after he submitted expense reports that included personal telephone calls.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Religious Leader</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2004, Long led a march with Bernice King to the grave of her father, Martin Luther King, Jr. The march was a protest against same-sex marriage and in support of a national constitutional amendment to limit marriage rights to couples comprising “one man and one woman.”</p><p>In 2005, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that between 1997 and 2000, Long received more than $3.07 million worth of compensation and benefits from his non-profit charity, ‘Bishop Eddie Long Ministries Inc.’ Long contended that the charity did not solicit donations from members but instead gained its income from royalties, speaking fees and several large donations.
