The end of the marriage was abrupt, Clara revealed. <b>Ryan broke up with her after they’d been out shopping for a house</b>, she said, adding that he said he could no longer trust her because of some candid comments she made about their lack of a sex life on the show.</p><p>What is Ryan from married at first sight Instagram? Ryan Oubre <b>(@ryanoubre)</b> • Instagram photos and videos.</p><p>Besides, Do Gil and Myra end up together?</p><p>While speaking with host Kevin Frazier, Gil and Myrla confirmed that they had recently broken up. “Unfortunately, since Decision Day, we have not been together,” Gil explained. “Fourteen days after Decision Day, Myrla decided she didn’t want to be with me anymore.”</p><p>Beside above, Are Miles and Karen still together?</p><p>Fans previously believed the couple split based on perceived social media clues. The Married at First Sight couple had a trip to Punta Cana planned for Spring 2022, which Miles spoke about on his Instagram page. But in an update, he announced that he would be canceling the bae-cation to focus on his mental health.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Amelia_and_Bennett_still_together></span><strong>Is Amelia and Bennett still together?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Married at First Sight season 11 couple Bennett Kirschner and Amelia Fatsi were one of the show’s true fan-favorite couples, and fans were shocked to learn that they had split.

This could be anyone and none of what Henry has portrayed till now points to the fact that he may have Asperger’s. But there will always be many opinions. Henry has been making efforts in his own little ways.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_woody_and_Amani_still_together_2022></span><strong>Are woody and Amani still together 2022?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There are less successful Married at First Sight marriages than divorces these days, but Amani Aliyya and Woody Randall from Season 11 are one of the couples still going strong. After Amani announced her pregnancy on Feb. 15, 2022, fans were left eagerly wondering about her due date.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Chris_and_Paige_still_married></span><strong>Are Chris and Paige still married?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Screen Rant notes Paige chose to divorce Chris at the end of the season but, by the reunion, she’d reconciled with him.

While he felt they should have a joint banking account, she didn’t agree because she liked her independence, telling him the term “a kept woman” makes her “cringe.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_ethnicity_is_Bao_and_Johnny></span><strong>What ethnicity is Bao and Johnny?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>But her husband Johnny “was ready for it,” he said. The IT professional – who told The List that his family was “a weird mix between Chinese and Vietnamese” – was excited to showcase his culture on the show. One way the couple did that was by having a traditional tea ceremony after their wedding.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Bai_and_Zach_dating></span><strong>Are Bai and Zach dating?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“I wish them the best.
