However, Plaintiff should not have to bear the cost of undoing the results of Defendant’s wrongful conduct, and attorney’s fees and costs are a part of a claim for common-law indemnification.&nbsp;</p><p>“Judgement should be entered in favor of Plaintiff against the Defendant Lakeisha Williams, for the full amount necessary to pay off the mortgage in favor of Defendant David Simon, trustee.&nbsp;</p><h2>BANKRUPTCY BID</h2><p>“Wherefore the Plaintiff, Richard Williams, demands judgment against the Defendant, Lakeisha Williams, compensatory damages, attorney’s fees, and costs, and all such other relief as appears just and appropriate under the circumstances, for the foregoing reasons.”</p><p>If Lakeisha fails with her bankruptcy bid, she will potentially lose her home, as the auction will continue with either Williams or Simon, plus other creditors, taking much of the proceeds from the sale.&nbsp;</p><p>Simon wants the new case to be thrown out and has subpoenaed both Lakeisha and Richard to appear, via Zoom, at DGIM Law offices in Aventura, FL, who are representing Simon.&nbsp;</p><p>He’s contesting Lakeisha’s claim that it’s her main home and should come under the Chapter 13 “homestead exemption.”</p><p>Simon has provided an affidavit signed by Lakeisha at the time of the loan in February 2017, which stated that “the debtor swore under oath that the House is not her homestead” and the “loan proceeds are to be used for business and commercial purposes.”&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of losing the house, Lakeisha wants to pay back her debts in installments, starting off at $8,293 for the first 15 months, $8,033 for the next 24 months, and $8,083 for the last 21 months, but Simon claims that Lakeisha’s monthly income isn’t enough to support the plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Richard bought the property in 1995 for $355,000 with Serena and Venus’s mom Oracene, before they divorced in 2002, and he retained the place as part of the breakup deal.</p><img decoding=async alt="Mama June accused of IGNORING kids while splashing $90K on ex-boy toy, 24" width=295 height=188 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pc-mama-june-accused-ignoring-comp.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async alt="Little People's Zach & Tori sell Oregon home for $30K above asking price after move" width=295 height=188 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-13-at-12.27.18-PM.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The Sun previously revealed Richard&nbsp;is now living in a new home in the same city, which is owned by their daughter&nbsp;Serena, who paid $815,000 for the one-story property in June 2015.</p><p>The place is perfect for Richard’s reported fragile state, all on one floor, and has four bedrooms, and five bathrooms, with over 4,160 square feet of room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/CW-KING-RICHARD-HOUSE-COMP-EXCL-copy.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AB-RICHARD-COMP.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pc-mama-june-accused-ignoring-comp.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OvqqGnp5e2u3vSnqmeppFixKq4y6KYpqtdma6lecqipaBlop6wqa3RnWShoaSoeqmx0WaqrZ2goryuedaiq6FlYaJ6tMHIrWSdnaOltrWxjK2fnqVdmruru9iipaBlkWLAqsbZpaCnn12osrl5y6Kdnmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./shawn-bradley-bio-age-net-worth-height-married-nationality-body-measurement-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shawn Bradley - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Nationality, Body Measurement, Career">&larr;
