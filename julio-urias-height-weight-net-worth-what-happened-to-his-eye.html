The Los Angeles Dodgers’ pitcher, who has easily recognized thanks to his sloppy left eye, was the youngest starting pitcher to make his debut in Major League Baseball in 2005 at the age of 19.</p><p>Since then, Urias has become a revelation for his team, as he is the youngest Dodgers pitcher to ever play on the field in the post-season. Read on to learn more about the relief pitcher’s career, family, income, and eye.</p><h2><strong>Julio Urias Early Life and Career</strong></h2><p>Julio Urias was born on August 12, 1996, in Culiacan, Mexico, the son of Juana Isabell and Carlos Urias as Julio Cesar Urias Acosta. According to his parents, Urias was almost always the youngest and most talented player on any field he played on during his childhood, having learned to play with his father as a toddler.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Julio-Urias.jpg><p>Urias’s talent was so impressive that at the age of 10 he started to join the Mexican national team on car trips before he later started playing with them. When he was 14 years old, he met the legendary Los Angeles Dodgers scout Mike Brito, who had already heard a lot of good things about his talent. Brito and the Dodgers were on the lookout for Urias, who further perfected his game by playing for the Diablos Rojos del Mexico of the Mexican League. The Dodgers waited until Urias turned 16 on August 12, 2012, before signing him.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Josh Hader Bio, Family, Salary, Height, Weight, Body Stats</a></strong></p><p>After he agreed to join the Los Angeles-based team, Julio Urias was assigned to the Great Lakes Loons in the Midwest League. Although he made his professional debut almost a year after signing the contract, Urias was still able to become the youngest player in the league on May 25, 2013. He celebrated his first game by hitting six clubs in three shutout innings. After a year with the Loons, Urias was assigned to the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the California League, where his performances earned him the Dodgers’ Minor League Pitcher of the Year award, as he was also selected for the All-Star Futures Game 2014 for the world team.</p><p>Following his impressive performances, the Dodgers Urias invited him to participate in their Major League Spring Training Camp before the 2015 season. However, Urias was the first to be eliminated from the squad as he was assigned to the Texas League AA Tulsa Drillers. After a few months, he moved up to the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers and finally secured a place in the Dodgers’ pre-2016 season rankings.</p><h2><strong>Julio Urias’ Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The net value of Julio Urias is unknown. The player, who has only played in two Major League Baseball seasons since 2018, was unable to reach his big payday, which will cause popular magazines and websites such as Forbes and celebritynetworth.com to calculate a number.</p><p>In its first season in Major League Baseball in 2017, the Los Angeles Dodgers, who themselves are the second most valued team in all Major League Baseball, paid Uriah $540 thousand dollars. In his second year, he put a contract worth 550 thousand dollars on paper.</p><h2><strong>What Happened To His Eye?</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_37070 class="wp-caption aligncenter amp-wp-inline-086b83d24e4412010a175ea3dba11ca3" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-37070></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Julio-Urias-and-Legendary-LA-Dodgers-scout-Mike-Brito.jpg><p>The first thing you notice when you look at Julio Urias is that his left eye seems either lazy or tired. Unfortunately, this is not the case, since the drooping eyelid of the jug is the result of the three operations he had as a child to remove a benign tumor. The operations were considered successful at that time, and Urias can see with his eye, although it seems to be closed all the time.</p><p>In 2015, Urias, who was still playing in the minor league, decided to undergo cosmetic surgery to further improve the eye and remove all of the periorbital benign mass.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Zach Davies Wife, Age, Height, Weight, Body Measurements</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Height and Weight</strong></h2><p>In Major League Baseball, where the average height of players playing as pitchers is 6 feet 0 inches, Julio Urias, with a height of 5 feet 11 inches or 1.83 meters, is one of the smaller players. He also weighs about 98 kg or 216 pounds, which is about 12 kg or 26 pounds more than the average baseball player.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kt7a4yKhkrqqZlsButMSinqGsXayyqrPHrWSnnaRixLC%2B06FksKCRqXqprc%2BpnKedlGLBsHnHoqpmnamafA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./maybelline-uses-bearded-men-to-advertise-new-makeup-line-and-people-are-furious.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maybelline Uses Bearded Men to Advertise New Makeup Line, and People Are Furious">&larr;
