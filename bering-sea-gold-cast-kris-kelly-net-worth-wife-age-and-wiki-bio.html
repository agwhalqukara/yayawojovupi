But his has not been an easy journey due to emotional breakdowns, crappy mining equipment, and a somewhat chaotic mining team. So why not recruit another team? Well, it’s rather hard to replace one’s brother and father. Yup, he works alongside Brad and Andy Kelly who are his father and younger brother respectively. Let’s find out Kris Kelly’s wife and married life. Also, check his net worth.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>From the producers of a hit tv series, “Deadliest Catch” narrated by <a href=#>Mike Rowe</a> also came Bering Sea Gold, a reality TV show about gold mining in both shallow and deep sea or ocean waters. The show documents various crews in their day to day gold searching and dredging activities during summer and spring. The cameras also capture their personal lives including relationships, fights, near-death experiences, stealing et cetera.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is-Bering-Sea-Gold-Kris-Kelly-Married-or-Dating-Whos-His-Wife-or-Girlfriend></span><strong>Is Bering Sea Gold Kris Kelly Married or Dating? Who’s His Wife or Girlfriend?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When one people gain fame, then their life becomes public. No matter how determined they get to keep their personal life a secret, someone always finds something to reveal. But Kris Kelly has to be one such star who has managed to keep his relationship life off screen.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I mean we have even met his dad’s girlfriend, Courtney, but Kris just won’t cave to all the curiosity fans have regarding his relationship status. He does, however, spend most of his offseason in Hawaii so maybe there’s a special someone there, who knows?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>We explore his social media pages like Facebook and Twitter, but I have to admit it, this guy is silent as the grave in social media. Few post about his jobs and tv shows but nothing about his wife, married life or even a relationship with a girlfriend.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Sorry to disappoint but we couldn’t find anything on Kris Kelly’s wife or married life. As far as we speculate, he is still single and not married.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kris-Kelly-Net-Worth-Salary></span><strong>Kris Kelly Net Worth, Salary</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bering Sea Gold Cast Kris Kelly Net Worth is estimated to be at least $100,000, and since he hasn’t had a successful career as a gold miner, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that most of Kris Kelly wealth comes from his Bering Sea Gold paycheck.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Gold mining and his TV career are his only known sources of income in his net worth. Kris Kelly’s salary remains undisclosed.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=His-Career></span><strong>His Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritydig.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Kriss-Kelly.jpg alt="Bering Sea gold Kris Kelly, Captain and co-owner of Reaper Mining." width=600 height=338 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Kris Kelly along with his father and brother began mining business in California. After California outlawed mining, they took their mining gigs to a new place, Hawaii. After spending years in mining gold, it was later in 2013 he got the chance to be a gold&nbsp;miner plus a television star when Bering Sea Gold’s third season premiered.</p><p>He started off as a diver on board The Minnow, Steve Riedel’s dredger. They did not have much if any success gold mining that season and consequently, Brad Kelly, Kris Kelly’s dad became the new owner and captain of The Minnow.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Brad renamed it “The Reaper” and Kris continued to work as a diver on the dredge but now under his dad. Soon afterward he became co-owner and captain of The Reaper and has been ever since.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, in the recently premiered season 10, Kris Kelly has a new dredger. Hopefully, it’s forever bye bye to the constant breakdown of equipment he’s been experiencing in the old dredger.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Other members of “Bering Sea Gold” includes, <a href=#>Emily Riedel</a>, <a href=#>Zeke Tenhoff</a>,&nbsp;<a class=bioGridTile__arrowLink href=#>Shawn Pomrenke</a>&nbsp;and others.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=How-Old-is-Kris-Kelly-Know-his-age-and-wiki-bio></span><strong>How Old is Kris Kelly?
