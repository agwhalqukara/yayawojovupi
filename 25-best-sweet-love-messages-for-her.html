It is the small things that matter in intimate relationships. Writing sweet love messages that adequately express your deepest feelings will warm her heart and allow her to appreciate the affection you have for her. However, the trick for writing the best romantic message for your lady lies in your ability to select the right words.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/3076b8fabf62dc75.jpeg><p class=align-left>One trick that was often used by men in the past was to find the most poetic romantic text you can lay your hands on and send it as it is to your person. However, things have changed over the past few years, and writing your customized message has become the new means of delivering your desired results, and if it is done well, it can solve your concern on how to make your girl blush. With all this said and done, it is wise to remember that the only way to melt her heart is by pouring your heart contents on paper as sweetly as you possibly can.</p><h2>What can I say to my girlfriend to make her smile?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/60b3cc12b47e4c9e.jpeg><p class=align-left>An ordinary conversation will surely not make her smile. However, subtle, funny messages will appeal to her sense of humour and possibly make her burst into laughter if not wear a sweet smile. Sending her deep love messages that tickle her fancy imagination will also make her smile in contentment. For instance, send her texts like:</p><ul><li>Is it legal to look that good? or</li><li>I thought that angels exist only in heaven but look at you! You are on earth.</li></ul><p class=align-left>These messages will make her feel like the queen she is. All you need to do is to be as honest as you possibly can. You might have also wondered, how can I make my girlfriend blush? Well, these two examples will give you something to work with. Below are 25 best messages for her that you probably might want to use to lighten her heart.</p><h3>Romantic love messages for her</h3><li>With you, every mountain is reduced to a mere hill, each challenge is reduced to a simple problem that can be handled with ease, every storm can be withered, and every trouble is nothing to worry about. I have found a counselor in you, a soothsayer full of realistic optimism and a listening companion. I thank God for you because you were made rightfully for me. I treasure you.</li><li>Of all my achievements, you are the greatest. Finding you was like finding the answers to my prayer. Sometimes, I laugh by myself at how blessed I am to have you by my side, and if there is any wish I would want to come true, it is seeing you. You are my heart.</li><li>The idea of love was foreign to me until you came my way and painted a clear picture of what it is. Often, I would mistake your beauty for it; I do not know why after holding you close I start mistaking your touch for it, then your voice, then your character, then your inner beauty until it dawned on me that I genuinely love everything about you. None of it was a mistake but an appreciation of who you are, and I have words of how I feel. I cherish you.</li><li>Before meeting you, history had limited my love life to heartbreaks and unpalatable relationships. My mind became a prisoner of negativity. But as soon as I laid my eyes on you, my heart got struck with a pleasant sensation of positivity, that I knew instantly that if this was not it, then there is none in the world. Now that I hold you in my arms, happy about everything that you are to me, I affirm my initial analysis that it was, and still is a beautiful feeling. I have never thought of a day without you.</li><li>My two favourite moments in my life are sunrises and sunsets because those are also your favourite moments in life. I do not know how we ended up being so alike, but I know everything falls into place seamlessly. You complete me.</li><h3>Most touching love messages</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/72f36d71bf7d7ad1.jpeg><li>Living life through your eyes is the most interesting adventure I get to experience by having you as my one and only. Experiencing fulfillment with you by my side is the wildest cherished dream that came true. Having you by my side through thick and thin is not only honourable but something I would not change for the world. With all these, I do not know if telling you of how I feel for you is adequate, but I will say it every day of my life until we cross to the afterlife. You are mine forever.</li><li>Every day I get to spend with you is another day I get to spend in heaven. You are an extension of heaven here on earth objectively created just for me to enjoy. You light my world with your kindness, faithfulness and inner beauty. If I would have to choose again, I will still choose you. You are my heartbeat today and forever.</li><li>There are days I wake up and pinch myself, wondering if I am true with you and not someone else. Looking at you lying next to me every night gives me a sense of security and fulfillment that finally the stars are smiling my way. Loving you is easy as you make it so simple to cherish you. I would give everything that I have just to keep experiencing this feeling. I want us to live forever in each other’s arms.</li><li>My biggest worry is not expressing myself pretty well for you to know how I am in love with you. Each time I think of you, I tend to get lost in my thoughts, with occasional smiles manifesting on my face as a reaction of my inner happiness. If there was a definition of perfection, it would be you. You are both my weakness, strength and more importantly, you are my world.</li><li>With you I get to be a villain, a hero, philanthropist, a man with a heart and feelings, a man with nothing to fear, a man of means, a man with everything but hate, and most importantly, a heart that only beats for one- and it is you. You are a sight to behold, a sound worth longing for, a bug to wish for and a lover who makes everything feel right. In another life, I will still choose you because that will still be the best choice I will ever make. My feelings for you are immeasurable.</li><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Best goodnight my love messages, wishes and quotes</strong></p><h3>Sweetest I love you message</h3><li>Time promised love when it matures, and true to its word I got you when I was ready to do it right. Little did I know that you were twice as willing to cherish me with affection. Ever since we got together, our affection has grown in leaps and bounds, now overflowing in goodness, kindness, generosity and utmost care.</li><li>Each time I sit down to think, I think of you. Each time I breathe, I smell your scent. Each time I sleep, I dream of you, and each time I open my eyes, all I see is you. I am obsessed. Some would say it is my downfall; only if they knew the strength I get from you. You are the reason I am who I am today.</li><li>Fairy tales are the creations of the mind, but for us, it is an existing reality. You were made for me my dear. In you, I saw an angel that conjured up a distant memory of what heaven looks like.</li><li>You are a flower in my garden that does not lose its vigour even amidst the harshest weather. You are a bright sun that warms my body without burning my skin. You are a drug that cures my heart.</li><li>Like a river flows down the slope, the love that flows in me quenches my body, mind, and spirit of any deficiency. You inspire my thinking, mostly planting the right seeds about the present and the future.</li><h3>Love messages for her from the heart</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/c151b2056740e711.jpeg><li>Writing a life story together has been the highest honour so far. I pray for more of these days as we head deep into the future. You are the answer I was praying for. You have been nothing short of kind, loving, caring and sweet. Only death can tear us apart.</li><li>Each morning I wake up with a smile knowing that you are next to me. You make my eyes light up with hope and my body full of energy to make the most out of the day. You are the love of my life and a blessing that I am looking forward to having for the rest of my life.</li><li>Hello, love. Today is as beautiful as you. I just want to remind you that I will climb every mountain and swim every ocean to be with you every day of my life. You are the love of my life, and I do not want to live a single day without you. You are treasured beyond your wildest imagination.</li><li>I have had many wishes in life, but you are the only one that came true. You are my perfection and my sense of direction. I light up when you tell me you love me. Babe, I will not trade this for anything. I will love you forever.</li><li>Each time I look at you, my heart burns with a desire foreign to me but beautiful all the same. You make my world light up, and my mere existence finds meaning. I grow fonder with each setting sun, yearning for our next encounter and knowing with a great sense of surety that all will be fine. I want you by my side until the end of time.</li><li>Looking into your eyes, I see a perfect paradise with angels, milk, and honey. It takes my breath away leaving me in a state of helplessness, and I like it. Listening to your soothing voice encourages me to become the best version of myself. If this is love, then may it forever remain.</li><li>I love to hear you say that you love me the same way hearing me say I love you makes you happy. I just want to remind you that I will do right by you and grow together with you every day for the rest of our lives. I will take you to the moon and back if that is what I need to do to prove myself.</li><li>Living life knowing that I made the right choice for my hearts custodian gives me the greatest feeling of pride. You are the best decision I ever made in life. My greatest possession so far.</li><li>You and I together is the best sight I can ever behold. If we were a song, then we would be the greatest hit, and I would love dancing to us, just as I love dancing with you every day of my existence. You will always be the girl after my heart even when we are old and grey.</li><li>If I had known my life would be this fine with you, I would have tracked you down sooner and saved myself some pain and lost time. However, now that I have you in my arms, I would do everything I possibly can to see the world with you. I will never let you out of my site. You are that special to me.</li><p class=align-left>Choosing the right sweet love messages to send the woman you treasure the most will make her understand that you are all she got. The advantages of letting her know her position in your life are immense. Your life will be easier and fulfilled if you do this right.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>:</p><ul><li>Best cute love quotes for him and her</li><li>30 best true love quotes and sayings</li><li>Best short love poems for her from him</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfHN9l2twZmplYsC4scStZKWnppp6rrHSrJignaNitaa%2BjaGrpqQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./disney-and-jazz-a-celebration.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Disney and Jazz: A Celebration">&larr;
