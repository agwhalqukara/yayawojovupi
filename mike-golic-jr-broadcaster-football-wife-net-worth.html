However, his ethnicity and <a href=#>religion</a> are currently unknown. Furthermore, we know very little about Mike’s early life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=mike-golic-jr-education>Mike Golic Jr. Education:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody readability=1><tr><td>Highest Qualification</td><td>Graduation</td></tr><tr><td>University</td><td>University of Notre Dame</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>High School</td><td>Northwest Catholic High School</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Mike Jr. went to Northwest Catholic <a href=#>High School</a>, where he was named the top lineman on the Northwest Catholic Indians High School football team.

On the other hand, his mom was an ordinary homemaker.</p><p>In addition, Golic grew up with his two siblings, Sydney and Jake. Because Jake is only a year younger than Mike, we suppose the two brothers competed fiercely during adolescence, as do most brothers.

As a result, by the time Golic started high school, he was already a great <a href=#>football player</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=mike-golic-jr-signs>Mike Golic Jr. Signs:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td>Sun Sign</td><td>Libra</td></tr><tr><td>Star Sign</td><td>Libra</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Sign Duality</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Sign Modality</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Mike Golic Jr. is 33 years old as of 2022, born on September 28, 1989.

More specifically, he received his first tattoo when he was nineteen, a winged cross on his arm.</p><p>Furthermore, because the tattoo was done the same year his grandfather and uncle died, he also had their initials inked.
