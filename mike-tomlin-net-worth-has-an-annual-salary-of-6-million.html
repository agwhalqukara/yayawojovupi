Similarly,&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Mike Tomlin</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>‘s fortune has touched the sky since his initial days as a coach due to his phenomenal run as a career. The Steelers’ coach is also one of the highest-paid coaches in NFL history.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So, what exactly is Mike Tomlin’s net worth, and where does he get his income? Why don’t you get the answer to that through this article? So stick with us to the end to find out how much the NFL coach has amassed and if he earns money from sources other than coaching.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mike_Tomlin_Net_Worth_And_Earnings></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Mike Tomlin Net Worth And Earnings</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Mike Tomlin has amassed a fortune of $16 million, with an annual salary of $6 million. Let’s look at his earnings and salary details to see how the NFL coach makes such big bucks.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Also Read:&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Find Out If Real Estate Investor Graham Stephan Is Married</span></strong></a></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Earnings_From_His_Time_As_A_College_Coach></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Earnings From His Time As A College Coach</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>All great coaches start somewhere. For Mike Tomlin, it was right from the bottom. Tomlin’s coaching career began his coaching career in 1995 as the wide receiver coach at Virginia Military Institute. The Steelers head coach was a natural from the beginning, captivating many people with his abilities on the field.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The football coach served as a graduate assistant for the defensive backs and special teams at the University of Memphis throughout the 1996 season. Following a brief coaching stint at the University of Tennessee, the Arkansas State University hired Mike in 1997. After two successful seasons, the University of Cincinnati appointed him as the defensive backs coach.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mike-Tomlin-Net-Worth.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Slowly, Mike made his way to the NFL with a lot of hard work and determination. Unfortunately, Tomlin’s salary information during his years as a college coach is unknown. Still, it is reasonable to assume that he might have earned a great deal given how many people admired him for his mental toughness and tactical game plans.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Income_As_A_Professional_NFL_Coach></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Income As A Professional NFL Coach</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After coaching university teams for many years, Mike Tomlin finally made his NFL debut in 2001 as a coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. With the Buccaneers, Tomlin achieved great success, and the team thrived under his leadership.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2006, the Minnesota Vikings‘ head coach <strong>Brad Childress</strong> appointed him as their defensive coordinator. He served the team for one season and even reunited with former William and Mary teammate&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Darren Sharper</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>who was the team’s safety at the time.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mike-Tomlin-Net-Worth-and-Earnings.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As time went on, Mike began to receive the credit he deserved, and millions praised his defensive strategies and ability to guide teams. So, Mike Tomlin’s fortune must have improved tremendously since joining the NFL.</span></p><h4><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Has Been Serving The Pittsburgh Steelers For Decades</span></h4><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Pittsburgh Steelers</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;hired Mike</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;as their head coach on January 27, 2007. Under the four-year contract, he&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>made about</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;$2.5 million a year. So, Mike Tomlin’s fortunes must have boosted substantially with such a lucrative deal.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tomlin led the squad to back-to-back victories as head coach and earned his place in many people’s hearts. The team even won the Super Bowl XLIII, making Mike Tomlin the youngest NFL coach in history to do so.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, the head coach was named the 2008 Motorola NFL Coach of the Year on January 29, 2009. He signed a three-year contract extension with the team on July 13, 2010. However, the specifics of the deal remain a guarded secret.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mike-Tomlin-Earnings-and-Net-Worth.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, the road to success is often filled with bumps along the way, and likewise, significant amounts have also been deducted from Mike Tomlin’s net worth to pay fines. Firstly, the NFL&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>fined Tomlin</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;$100,000 on December 4, 2013, for his actions on the field. The amount tied for the second-highest fine for a coach in NFL history.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Then again, the NFL</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;fined the</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;head coach another $100,000 for not properly wearing a face mask. Fortunately, Mike has not committed any further wrongdoing after the mask incident.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Mike then&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external><span data-preserver-spaces=true>signed a</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true> three-year contract extension to remain the Steelers’ head coach through 2024 on April 20, 2021.
